# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:

##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "✅ UI IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED: Successfully implemented 2 UI enhancements as requested: 1) REMOVED 'Great Value' section from homepage - eliminated the budget-friendly products section with 💎 emoji badge that appeared after Premium Collection, streamlining the homepage layout 2) MADE SEARCH BAR TRANSPARENT - updated ProductSearchBar.tsx to change background from 'bg-white' to 'bg-transparent', making the search bar blend seamlessly with header elements and match the overall design aesthetic. Search bar now has a clean, transparent look that integrates better with the header's visual hierarchy. Both changes tested and confirmed working across all pages."

      message: "✅ HOMEPAGE & HEADER STYLING UPDATES: Successfully implemented 2 requested styling improvements: 1) HERO TEXT NOW SOLID WHITE - Changed 'Professional Acrylic Braille Signs' hero title from gradient text (with WebkitTextFillColor: transparent) to solid white text by removing gradient background properties and adding 'text-white' class in HeroSection.tsx. Text now always displays in pure white color with proper text shadow for readability. 2) LOGO BORDER & BACKGROUND ADDED - Updated logo in Header.tsx to match styling of other header elements (currency switcher, phone, hours). Logo now wrapped in container with conditional styling: homepage gets 'bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20' (semi-transparent white with border), other pages get 'bg-muted/30 border border-gray-200'. Logo now has consistent visual treatment with rounded corners (rounded-lg) and padding (px-4 py-2), creating cohesive header design. Both changes enhance visual hierarchy and brand consistency across the site."

      message: "✅ HERO DESCRIPTION & CHAT BUTTON UPDATES: Successfully implemented 2 additional UI improvements: 1) HERO DESCRIPTION NOW SOLID WHITE - Changed description text 'Professional quality door signs, restroom signs, and custom architectural signage for modern workspaces.' from 'text-white/90' (90% opacity) to 'text-white' (100% opacity) in HeroSection.tsx. Description text now displays in pure white color for maximum visibility and readability on hero background. 2) CHAT BUTTON MOVED TO BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER - Completely redesigned desktop contact CTA in MobileFloatingCTA.tsx. Changed from full-width bottom bar spanning entire screen to floating button in bottom right corner (fixed bottom-6 right-6). New design: circular gradient button (cyan-500 to blue-600) with MessageCircle icon and 'Get Quote' text, featuring shadow-xl, hover effects (scale-105, shadow-2xl), and rounded-full styling. Desktop chat button now matches mobile placement philosophy while maintaining professional appearance. Both changes improve user experience and visual consistency."
